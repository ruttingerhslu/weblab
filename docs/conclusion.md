# Conclusion

The learning curve of React was not as steep as I originally thought. With a background in Angular, the concepts were similar, except for the usage of MaterialUI, where I didn't exactly know which components to use. In the end, I managed to create a usable interface, which didn't distract too much from the functionality of the system itself.

Also the decision to only split the admin view not entirely and display them as routes on the same SPA, as well as depending on the JWT token to provide the user's role worked well for my use case.

I regret, however, that I didn't use proper *TDD* in my workflow and ended up having to write tests as an afterthought, rather than developing against them. This took a while, considering that I had to reevaluate what each function's purpose was, in order to test it properly.

In conclusion, the project helped me refresh my memory on developing a fullstack system, and also taught me a lot on frameworks like React and Express, which I didn't know before.
