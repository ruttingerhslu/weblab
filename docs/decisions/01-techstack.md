# MERN techstack

## Context and Problem Statement

A dedicated techstack is to be chosen, before anything is to be implemented, as part of the assignment. That way both the student is limited in their domain, and the lecturer knows beforehand what to expect.

## Considered Options

* MERN: *MongoDB*, *Express*, *React* and *Node*
* MEAN: *MongoDB*, *Express*, *Angular* and *Node*
* Ruby on Rails
* Pick and choose from varying frameworks

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MERN", because I haven't had much experience with React as opposed to Angular and the other two options seemed like too much of a learning curve. Also, choosing a techstack that is widely used comes with plenty of online help to potential problems.

### Consequences

* Good, because there are alot of resources on building an application using the MERN stack.
* Good, because the setup was relatively easily as compared to other projects, I've done.
* Bad, because I could've had the chance to learn other frameworks or DB systems.
